# Bank Loan Analysis and Dashboard Using Excel

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing bank loan data to understand patterns, trends, and key insights with a focus on distinguishing between good and bad loans, performing time series analysis, and categorizing loans based on US states and regions. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, and a comprehensive dashboard was created to visualize the findings. The primary objective was to assist the bank in making data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, risk assessment, and customer profiling.

## Data Description
The dataset used for the analysis included the following attributes:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each loan application
- **address_state**: State in the US where the loan was issued

- **next_payment_date**: Date of the next scheduled payment
- **member_id**: Unique identifier for the borrower
- **purpose**: Purpose of the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement)

- **int_rate**: Interest rate on the loan
- **loan_amount**: Amount of loan requested
- **total_acc**: Total number of credit accounts
- **total_payment**: Total amount paid by the borrower

## Analysis Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
3. **Loan Performance Analysis**: Differentiated between good and bad loans to identify patterns and risk factors.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Examined loan approval trends over time.
5. **Regional Analysis**: Analyzed loan data based on US states and regions to identify geographical trends.
6. **Loan Approval Rate**: Analyzed the approval rate based on various factors such as application type, employment length, and verification status.
7. **Income Analysis**: Compared annual income and debt-to-income ratio for good and bad loans.
8. **Loan Amount Distribution**: Visualized the distribution of loan amounts and terms.
9. **Credit History Impact**: Assessed the impact of credit history and total accounts on loan performance.

## Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard included the following visualizations:
- **Good vs. Bad Loans**: Pie chart showing the proportion of good vs. bad loans.
- **Loan Approval Trends**: Line chart depicting loan approvals over time.
- **Regional Distribution**: Map chart illustrating loan distribution across US states and regions.
- **Loan Approval Rate**: Pie chart showing the proportion of approved vs. non-approved loans.
- **Income Comparison**: Bar chart comparing annual income for good and bad loans.
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of loan amounts.
- **Credit History**: Bar chart depicting loan performance based on total accounts and credit pull dates.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Various charts illustrating loan performance based on employment length, home ownership status, and purpose.

## Insights
- **Good vs. Bad Loans**: Identified key characteristics and risk factors associated with bad loans.
- **Time Series Trends**: Observed seasonal patterns and trends in loan approvals.
- **Regional Trends**: Detected regional variations in loan approval rates and performance.
- **Credit History**: Applicants with a better credit history and more total accounts had a significantly higher approval rate.
- **Income Levels**: Higher annual incomes and lower debt-to-income ratios were correlated with good loans.
- **Demographics**: Certain demographic groups, such as those with longer employment lengths and home ownership, had higher loan performance.

## Conclusion
The bank loan analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions, loan performance, and regional trends. The dashboard facilitated easy visualization and interpretation of the data, enabling the bank to refine their loan approval process and reduce risk. The use of Excel for data analysis and dashboard creation demonstrated its capability as a powerful tool for financial data analysis.
