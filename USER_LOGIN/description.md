# Database Querying Project

This project involves querying the database to retrieve data from the `login` and `users` tables. The queries utilize Common Table Expressions (CTE), recursive CTEs, and other SQL techniques to effectively retrieve and analyze the data.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to perform complex queries on the `login` and `users` tables. The key techniques used include:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**
- **Recursive CTEs**
- **Joins and Subqueries**
