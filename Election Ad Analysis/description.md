**If you are highly active on Facebook and Instagram, you must have seen ads based on elections by any of the political parties, especially BJP and INC. All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Meta ads about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian elections 2024 in each state. In this Project, we perform elections ad spending analysis using Python and how it impacted the voting patterns.**
